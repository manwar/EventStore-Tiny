All these attributes can be manipulated by setters/getters with the attribute's name or can be set on construction:

=head3 uuid

This event's UUID. By default a new UUID is created.

=head3 timestamp

This event's timestamp. By default a new timestamp of the creation time is set.

=head3 name

This event's name. Setting this attribute on construction is required.

=head3 transformation

This event's state transformation function, represented by a subref. By default it does nothing, so it should be set as a reasonable subref changing the given state argument (as a hashref) based on the given data (as a hashref) by side-effect.

=head2 METHODS

=head3 apply_to

    $event->apply_to(\%state, $logger);

Applies this event's L<transformation> to the given state (by side-effect). If a C<$logger> as a subref is given, it is used to log this application.
