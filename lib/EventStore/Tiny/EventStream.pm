=head1 NAME

EventStore::Tiny::EventStream

=head1 REFERENCE

EventStore::Tiny::Stream implements the following attributes and methods.

=head2 events

    my $event17 = $stream->events->[16];

Internal list representation (arrayref) of all events of this stream.

=head2 add_event

    $stream->add_event($event);

Adds an event to the stream.

=head2 length

    my $event_count = $stream->length;

Returns the number of events in this stream.

=head2 first_timestamp

    my $start_ts = $stream->first_timestamp;

Returns the timestamp of the first event of this stream.

=head2 last_timestamp

    my $end_ts = $stream->last_timestamp;

Returns the timestamp of the last event of this stream.

=head2 apply_to

    my $state = $stream->apply_to(\%state);

Applies the whole stream (all events one after another) to a given state (by default an empty hash). The state is changed by side-effect but is also returned.

=head2 substream

    my $filtered = $stream->substream(sub {
        my $event = shift;
        return we_want($event);
    });

Creates a substream using a given filter. All events the given subref returns true for are selected for this substream.

=head2 until

    my $pre_stream = $stream->until($timestamp);

Returns a substream with all events before or at the same time of a given timestamp.

=head2 after

    my $post_stream = $stream->after($timestamp);

Returns a substream with all events after a given timestamp.
